# hello-world
Just another hello world project.
My name is Jalen and I am 24 years of age.
My goal for this project is to attain an understanding of github in order to create and maintain my own projects.
Once I achieve this goal I will be able to move on to developing applications I can use for a portfolio.
I have completed this project just a few minutes ago. I am now trying to replicate the lesson without the guide.
So far this is going well. I think... Lol JK it's pretty easy this project. We'll see what the future brings!
